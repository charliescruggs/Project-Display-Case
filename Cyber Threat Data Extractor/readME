This python script takes an xml file as input. The XML file contains 1000â€™s of documents. 

Each document could be 1 of 4 types: 
1. collective_intelligence 
2. cyber_incident
3. cyber_threat
4. cyber_vulnerability

The output of this program are these 4 different documents as spreadsheets or CSV files. 
The program uses beautiful soup to parse this data, and then carries over necessary columns
to the newly formatted CSV files.

I do not have access or permission to share the data used by this application. Therefore 
it can not be operated. However, my documented source code is available. A general 
understanding can be made as to what it does by reading the documentation in the code.
