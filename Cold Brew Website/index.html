      <h1>The Cold Brew System</h1>
      <p>Typically Cold Brew is made using an Immersion Brewing system. This system any kind of basic filtering method to filter grains our of water that has steeping with grinds for 12-16 hours. This results in a less acidic or less bitter tasting coffee. The image you see here shows grounds steeping in a French Press.

      <h2>The Nitro System </h2>

      <p>Arguably the best way to serve Cold Brew Coffee is on trap using nitrogen to infuse the drink to a creamy consistency. Additionaly to being infused as it is poured, the Cold Brew is also charged with Nitrogen in a keg before it is served. Additional Nitrogen being used in the keg acts as a way to preserve the drink so every pour is as good as the first.</p>

      <p>A typical Cold Brew 'set up' consists of a kegarator, a keg of Cold Brew, a nitrogen tank to contiuously charge the Cold Brew, another nitrogen tank to infuse the drink as its poured, and the hosing and tap hardware to draw the drink from the rest of the system.</p>
