Locate downloaded jar file in your command line then type ‘java -jar UserLogin1.jar’ into your command line. 
Alternatively, you may be able to simply select the executable jar to run depending on the settings on your 
computer. If you are still having issues, I recommend downloading the source code (link below) and compiling 
& running in your preferred IDE. 

This is a personal project I created on my own. It is still a work in progress. Eventually, it will embody 
the features of the more complex Login Project 2. For now it is only a prototype Interface.
