This is a project I created for a Java programming course in university. User Login Project 2 has a console
interface where the menu is printed back to the user in a loop until they choose to exit. The login 
information is accessed and stored in a sample file called users.txt within the src folder of this project.

This program provides the base behavioral structure which will be implemented as a GUI for Login Project 1.
It will utilize buttons, windows, textboxes and data (user info) storage, as opposed to the menu printing method.
