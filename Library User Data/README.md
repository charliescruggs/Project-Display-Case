This project converts a CSV file into an XML file while normalizing values to match the data model of their destination. 
This was part of a project to integrate Users from another college into the William & Mary library IT system. 
Some values were simply wrapped in XML tags while others needed their values prepared first, and then wrapped in XML tags. 
Other non-important values were omitted from the resulting dataset.

This program was created during an internship. The sample dataset accessed by this code has been modified so it does not 
reveal legitimate user information.
